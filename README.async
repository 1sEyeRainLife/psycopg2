Asynchronous support in psycopg
*******************************

The support for asynchronous queries in psycopg is only half-backed and
won't work unless a good deal of time is put into fixing bugs. Currently
I (the author) have no need for asycnhronous queries but patches are
welcome. Also welcome are short tests that show how the async path fails
(miserably) so that I can at least fix obvious problems.
