**This is a bug tracker**

- This is not a support forum. If you have a question such as "how do you do X" please:
  - first google,
  - then [subscribe to the mailing list](https://lists.postgresql.org/manage/) and ask there.

- If you have problems installing psycopg, it's most likely not a bug: you are missing a dependency. Please read the [install documentation](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html).
