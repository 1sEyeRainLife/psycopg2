Compiling and installing psycopg
********************************

While psycopg 1.x used autoconf for its build process psycopg 2 switched to
the more pythoning setup.py. Currently both psycopg's author and distutils
have some limitations so the file setup.cfg is almost unused and most build
options are hidden in setup.py. Before building psycopg look at the very
first lines of setup.py and change any settings to follow your system (or
taste); then:

    python setup.py build

to build in the local directory; and:

    python setup.py install
    
to install system-wide.
