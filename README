psycopg - Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter
********************************************

psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
language. This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to
provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other sweet
candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of being
very small and fast, and stable as a rock.

psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
UPDATEs. psycopg 2 also provide full asycronous operations for the really
brave programmer.

There are confirmed reports of psycopg 1.x compiling and running on Linux
and FreeBSD on i386, Solaris, MacOS X and win32 architectures. psycopg 2
does not introduce build-wise incompatible changes so it should be able to
compile on all architectures just as its predecessor did.

Now go read the INSTALL file. More information about psycopg extensions to
the DBAPI-2.0 is available in the files located in the doc/ direcory.
